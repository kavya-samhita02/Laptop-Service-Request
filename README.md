This project is a web-based system designed to streamline the process of submitting, tracking, and managing laptop service and repair requests. It provides a simple interface for users (employees or students) to log issues, and a robust backend for administrators/IT staff to efficiently manage the workflow, assign technicians, and track the repair status.

âœ¨ Features
User Request Submission: A straightforward form for users to detail their laptop issues, including make/model, issue description, and urgency.

Request Tracking: Users can view the real-time status of their submitted requests (e.g., Pending, In Progress, Awaiting Parts, Resolved).

Admin/Technician Dashboard: A dedicated view for IT staff to see all open requests, prioritize them, and assign them to technicians.

Email Notifications: Automated email updates to users when the status of their request changes.

Historical Data: A record of all past requests for reporting and analysis.
